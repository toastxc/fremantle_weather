# Deployment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/toastxc/fremantle_weather.git
cd fremantle_weather
vi token.txt # enter a token from https://www.openuv.io/
docker-compose up -d
```
# What is this?
A quickly made demo of using Dioxus with a backend. The site polls a openuv.io for the UV conditions of Fremantle, Western Australia and displays them.

# Future
I may add support for different regions or more comprehensive data in future.
